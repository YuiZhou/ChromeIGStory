### How does Chrome IG Story work?
Chrome IG Story injects your friend's Instagram Stories above your feed on the Instagram.com desktop website just like it appears in the Instagram mobile app.

Simply click on the icon of the Instagram user to view their Story. You can use the arrow keys to navigate forward and back, and press the Esc key to close the gallery.

Right click the icon of the Instagram user to download their Story.

You can see Suggested Stories if you go to the Explore feed.

### Why does the profile picture border not turn gray after I view a Story?
Currently, Chrome IG Story does not mark the Story as being "seen", so all new content will remain new if you view it with this extension. If you view that user's Story on your phone and refresh the page, the new content will be gray.

### Can I share an image/video from someone's Story?

You can right click the image/video in the galley and "Copy Image/Video Address" to grab the link of the photo or video and share it. However, be respectful of the user's privacy when sharing the URL, as the link will work until Instagram deletes the photo/video off its server (sometimes days after the Story has expired).
